### 🎮 Snake Eater Game Guide

**Snake Eater** is a simple  snake game built using the **Pygame** library. In this game, you  control a  snake that is looking for food, and each time it eats, its body grows longer. Your goal is to keep the snake alive for as long as possible and avoid colliding with the wall or its own body.

#### 1. **Starting the Game**
   - When you run the program, the game window opens, and the snake starts moving around.
   - You can change the direction of the snake using the arrow keys or `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` keys.

#### 2. **Game Controls**
   - `↑` or `W`: Move Up
   - `↓` or `S`: Move Down
   - `←` or `A`: Move Left
   - `→` or `D`: Move Right
   - `Esc`: Exit the game

#### 3. **Game Over**
   - If the snake collides with the wall or its own body, the game ends, and a screen will appear showing a message that you can restart the game by clicking the "Restart" button.
   - Your score is also displayed on the screen.

#### 4. **Difficulty Level**
   - The game has difficulty settings by default, which you can adjust by changing the `difficulty` variable:
     - **Easy** -> 10
     - **Medium** -> 25
     - **Hard** -> 40
     - **Harder** -> 60
     - **Impossible** -> 120
     - 

#### 5. **Score**
   - With each piece of food the snake eats, your score increases. The score is displayed at the top of the screen.

#### 6. **Restarting the Game**
   - After the game ends, a screen appears giving you the option to restart the game by clicking the "Restart" button.
